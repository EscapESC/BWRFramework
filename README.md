# BWRFramework
Boiling Water Reactor simulator framework designed around BWR4 with the RBMK-1000s power output by default is ment to be used in nuclear power plant games/simulators as a base that with one call function updates the reactor state and simulate it as realistically as possible.

## Now implemented:

### Reactor core:
- [x] Neutron / neutron transfer
- [x] Channels
- [x] Boiling
- [x] Xenon
- [x] Iodine
- [x] Basic void coefficient
- [x] 3D core

### Coolant system:
- [x] rcPumps
- [x] fwPumps
- [ ] fwHeaters
- [x] Turbine
- [ ] Condenser
- [ ] Deadorator

### Support system
- [ ] Everything
